## "Class Project for Getting and Cleaning Data"

The aim of the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning) project is to read the data sets from the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), to perform an analysis and to compute an output tidy data set. 

Just run the R script ([run_analysis.R](https://github.com/Samarkande/GCD/blob/master/run_analysis.R)) to get the required tidy data set ([mytidydata.txt](https://github.com/Samarkande/GCD/blob/master/mytidydata.txt)). 

You can also read the [code book](https://github.com/Samarkande/GCD/blob/master/CodeBook.md) for more details. Enjoy!
